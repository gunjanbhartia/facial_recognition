Understanding and predicting human emotions using different deep learning algorithms and 
models have become one of the important domains to research as emotion recognition helps 
in understanding human behaviors. Recognizing emotions by analyzing the different facial 
expressions is the main aim of this research. This paper investigates the application of 
different machine learning algorithms especially deep learning algorithms to understand 
human emotion based on a photographic image of a human face and predict the emotion 
where the dataset used to train the model is collected using open web source Kaggle and is an 
image-based dataset, as the model input will be a different human face. The dataset is 
annotated with different emotions such as ‘angry’, ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘surprise’ etc. The primary 
focus during the entire research is understanding and exploring different Convolutional. 
Recurrent neural network models with long short-term memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural 
Networks (DNN) are useful for sequential data. They use memory cells and gates to regulate 
data flow between layers, allowing the outcome of one layer to be repeatedly transferred back 
to the previous layer. Different Optimization techniques such as Adam optimizer are used to 
fine-tune and optimize the deep learning model and these optimization techniques are based 
on the classification algorithm. This research work ends with an overview of the findings, 
inferences from the study, and recommendations for future enhancements for face emotion 
recognition which enhances the field of face expression recognition.
